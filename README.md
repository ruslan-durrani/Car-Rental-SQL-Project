## 📌 About This Project

This project was created for my Data Mining and Discovery module.  
I built a complete **Car Rental Database System** using SQLite.

I chose this topic because I work part-time at *International Herts Rental Car*, so I wanted to design something that feels realistic and is based on real-life rental operations.

This project includes:

- SQL database and schema  
- Python Faker script for generating data  
- Jupyter notebook for analysis  
- SQL and Python tests  
- ERD diagram  
- Data cleaning, filtering, joining, grouping and visualisations  

All data in this project is **fake** and created using the Faker library.
